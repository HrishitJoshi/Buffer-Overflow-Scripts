mona command to generate bad-char

  !mona bytearray -b "\x00"
  NOTE - Generate a bytearray using mona, and exclude the null byte (\x00) by default. Note the location of the bytearray.bin file that is generated.
  
 Post Exploitation from the bad char payload (use the python script to generate the payload)
 
  Mona command to compare the stack with the regular sequence.
    !mona compare -f <PATH-TO-bytearray.bin> -a <%ESP-address>
    
    "C:\mona\oscp\bytearray.bin" or "bytearray.bin" are the most probable path.
    
    A popup window should appear labelled "mona Memory comparison results". If not, use the Window menu to switch to it. The window shows the results of the comparison, indicating any characters that are different in memory to what they are in the generated bytearray.bin file.

    NOTE - Not all of these might be badchars! Sometimes badchars cause the next byte to get corrupted as well, or even effect the rest of the string.
